## About the App
This is a quiz app create using Vue JS. It allows students to attempt quizzes and teachers to upload new multiple choice quizzes.

### Where does the app fail?
The app lacks role based authentication as of now. It is adjusted in the backend, but there is no registration element.
Some elements have their opacity set to 0. Now, while one can set css of elements in vue, trying that did not work and remains to be a bug that has to be fixed.

## Future Goals
Use Item Response Theory to serve the quality of the quiz to the creator and allow him/her to make a quiz based on his/her needs quickly by just selecting some parameters.
